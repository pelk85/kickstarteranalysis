# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project & Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to allow Louise to be setup for the best possible chance at success with their play Kickstarter. This was done by analyzing relevant data from completed kickstarters and presenting that information in its raw, formatted and visualized forms. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Overall analysis shows that the Theatre category is quite successful in Kickstarter, with 66% of campaigns reaching their goal. This data point carries through as we look at the Plays subcategory, with 66% of campaigns in the United States reaching successful funding. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of theatre projects launched indicates that May is the most succesful month, with June and July following suit. The least successful funding time for the campaigns falls in November and December, there is a potential correlation here with the holiday and lower spending on crowdfunding by donors. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When looking at play campaign outcomes by goal there is an interesting mix of data. The lowest dollar campaigns have the higest percentage of success, tappering off above $5,000 USD. However the data indicates that campaigns begin to rise in success rate again when they breach the $30,000 USD mark, with a success rate close to 70% for those campaigns in the $35-$50,000 range. The success rate plummits again above $50,000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data is based on global data, and not all charting exercises filtered data to US only kickstarters which leads to assumptions based on different data sets depending on the chart we are looking at. 

Additionally the use of COUNTIFS can be very powerful but it also results in very long manual formulas that are difficult to clone to other data points and require manual editing slowing down analysis. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Louise should launch their campaign in the summer. 
A campaign's liklihood for success might be hindered by launching during the holiday season of November-December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Very small projects are likely to be successful. 
Large projects can also have a high chance for success, but should keep their funding goal south of $50,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It is only one source of crowdfunding. Play kickstarters may do better on other platforms such as IndieGoGo or GoFundMe. 

There is no relationship data between donors and campaign runners. Campaigns could have been successful based on funding from existing relationships and merely used Kickstarter as a platform. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Outcomes based on goal for US based campaigns. 

Outcomes based on goal for each category under theatre. Perhaps there is another category that is related but more successful that could be used.
